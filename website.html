  if you are reading this, then presumably you were sent it.  i would like to avoid this being 
  shared with anyone outside of the people who received it from me.  we will see how long that
  lasts.
</p>

<p>
  anyways,
</p>

<p>
  this figures to be my way of communicating with y'all en masse while I am down here.  that isn't
  to say that i do not want you to still reach out independently when you feel inclined.  i just thought
  this could be fun.
</p>

<p>
  the more i learn about html, css, and js, the more this site will change.  presumably.
  at the present moment, i feel like i am a bit paralyzed by choice.  what is the aesthetic direction i want to take this?
  also, i am simply too busy to care to put a gargantuan amount of effort into something that I might be able to only access 
  once or twice a week depending on internet connection.  i suppose i will find out this coming friday the 18th-24th
</p>

<p>
  look forward to more songs of the days, dumb pictures, and personal reflections.
hopefully this will be fun for y'all too.
</p>

<p>and yes, i have not yet activated the buttons so keep clicking away if you'd like</p>

<p>. <p>
